/**
 * PainlessDao is the base class for data adapters. The class can be used in many
 * different ways, but the preferred usage is to use it as a Data Mapper.
 *
 * Note that the DAO class is the ONLY class in the framework that uses an
 * underscore prefix for protected and private members. This is not a break in
 * the convention but rather, an intended exception. Specifically, since DAOs
 * are meant to be used like an object, where each property maps to a cell in the
 * data store. These public properties will automatically be sanitized, which is
 * a function provided by the DAO base class (since it applies to all DAOs), and
 * thus adding an underscore prefix to properties that are never meant to be
 * sanitized would provide a good mechanism to filter out unwanted operations.
